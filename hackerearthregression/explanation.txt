For the  test ,train dataset 

step1:checking the infromatin about the date like shape of the data and statical information about the data

step2:checking the categorical variable and numerical values

step3:cleaning the data means removing the null values

step4:for categorical value we use mode to fill the null vales,for numerical values we use either mean,median to fill all null values

step5:now,checking the correlation between values to know that whether each any features are related to each other 


step6:we use some data visulization techinques to  check how data is disturbuted

step7:merging the test dataset to trainset and finally checking above steps


step8:partioning data again to train and test

step9:final step is to model the data by using diffenent algorthims such as randomforest,navie bayes 

step10:applying hyperparamter turning for the choosen model and modelling the data to get better accuracy
